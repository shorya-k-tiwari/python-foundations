# Python Foundations

This repository documents my progression from Python fundamentals to
machine learning and research-level programming.

The focus is not speed or shortcuts, but depth, clarity, and correctness.

## Structure

01-Syntax-Mastery/
- Core Python syntax
- Control flow, data types, functions
- Clean, readable, predictable code

02-Computational-Physics/
- Physics-based programs
- Kinematics, dynamics, numerical simulations

03-Mathematical-Foundations/
- Algebra, calculus, linear algebra implemented in code

04-Logic-Algorithms/
- Algorithmic thinking
- Data structures and problem decomposition

05-Research-Projects/
- Larger systems
- Experimentation, analysis, and documentation

## Rules

- No copy-paste learning
- No blind library usage
- Every program must be explainable line-by-line
- Progress is incremental and permanent
